## #thoughts
### Pratit introduced me to an app called invstr, it seems to gamify investing and you win rewards according to how good your strategy is. Unfortunately, you pay for all your simulated trades - it seems. So, I am unlikely to use it in the long term.
### New web page is looking good! Just going to cut it down.
## #Learnings
### Created a google API key today - annoyingly you have to have an existing #googlecloud project and then you go to the *APIs & Services* section and then click *create credentials*, make sure to restrict its use, so that it is only used where it is supposed to be used. I.e. intelligentnetworks.ai

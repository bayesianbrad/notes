## #thoughts
### It has taking me so long to get started on thesis this morning. I notice that I really do procrastinate when I don't want to do something. Yet, if I understood, that once this task is done, it's done forever and can then move on with my life and my life with #Tsechu. Then maybe that would help. I'm so close to the end of it. It is literally less than 4 pages!!!

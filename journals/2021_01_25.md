## #thoughts
### [[goal]] I need to track my time better.
### I need to get better sleep discipline.
### My mood feels quite low today, I think it's because I feel torn inside. I want to be with #Tsechu as soon as possible and provide us the future we would like, but unless the company generates revenue and grows fast, it will be unlikely.
#### **Solution** If i create killer products, that will mean faster contacts and a faster path to revenue. Better investment terms and even a better chance of accessing the innovation fund.
#### To get to this solution focus on the steps to the solution and break it down

## First thing to note, they are an architectural approach and may not be required in many instances. So completely understand your context before diving in.
## __Where they work__
### When the core _thing_ has stabilized.
### Allow for several developers to work in the same system without getting in each others way - enables people to work independently and reduces scope for errors.
### Software-as-a-service is a good fit, as these products have to operate 24x7 which creates challenges when rolling out changes.
### Scalability - since they can be scaled up and down in an instance, and you can understand load characteristics so can price in compute effectively.
### You can get the most out of #cloud frameworks and can test new frameworks out quickly to see what works and what doesn't.
### It enables you to keep all options open.
## __Where they don't work__
### new products and start-ups - if the given domain/problem is constantly changing.
### If the customer is the one that deploys and manages the software.

## Each Microservice has its own data base.

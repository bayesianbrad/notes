## What are cost involved in trading?
### #CFD
#### if the stock pays dividends, and you are SHORT, you must pay the dividend.
#### If you are LONG the position, you receive the dividend just as normal.
#### if you hold your position over night you will be charged a SWAP fee, kind of like interest on the money you are borrowing for the trade.
#####
$$Quantity \times Swap Rate (instrument or position) \times Number of Nights$$
###### **Example**
####### Long “Buy” position of 100 Gold units for 7 nights.
######## 100 x (-0.1713544) x 7 = -119,94 USD
####### If FOREX, SWAP rate calculated in the second currency of the couple. All other SWAp rates calculated in the currency the instrument is held in.

title: How to set-up payroll and pension scheme
---
#### Step 1: Register with accounting software like [[Xero]]
#### Step 2: Connect a Bank account, you may have different accounts for payroll, expenses and revenue etc, but for most small companies you will just have one main business account.
#### Step 3: Register with HMRC, you will need the following:
##### First register company so that you can be sent you UTR, unique tax reference.
##### Then register for PAYE on HMRC site: www.gov.uk/paye-for-employers
###### You will then receive two codes a `PAYE reference` and a 13 digit `Accounts office reference` - you will need this for setting up the HMRC part of [[Xero]].
####### You will then receive a 12 digit activation code
####### See here for details: https://help.payfit.com/hc/gb/articles/360008332640-How-to-create-an-HMRC-account
####### This 12 digit code will be required so that you can create your RTI username and password, which is required for [[Xero]] to send your #tax information to HMRC.
#######
#### Step 4: On [[Xero]] under settings, click `Payroll` and add the HMRC information. For the banking, you will need to get a BACS number, if they don't do faster payments.
##### Step 4b:  In settings Set-up the holidays and payroll calendars - we use Monthly, as employees get paid salary each month. Ensure all employees join on a payday - then you don't need to worry about weird pay arrangements. You will need something different for contractors. [[Xero]] default settings are fine.
##### Step 4c: For pensions, you need to register with a pension scheme first, and you should hopefully be able to find this scheme provider in the [[Xero]] list. We used [[Smart Pensions]]. You typically want to have a "Net pay arrangement" - most tax effective if the employee qualifies for a pension, see Step 5 for all the pension set up details.

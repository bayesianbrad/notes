### #strategies for trading currency pairs
#### Many pairs of currencies are correlated between one another, or via a particular equity.
##### Positive correlations mean currencies move in same direction
##### Negative correlations mean they move in opposite directions
##### **Some examples**:
###### #CAD is correlated with Oil. Higher oil price, implies higher #CAD and lower #USD as #USD decreases with increasing oil prices.
####### This means that when the price of the #USD increases, the price of oil tends to decrease. It also means that an increase in the price of oil usually causes a decrease in the value of the #USD . As a result, traders could use this information to take a long position on the Canadian dollar – such as in the [[CAD/JPY]] pair – when oil is rising, or take a short position on the US dollar – such as in the [[USD/CAD]] pair – when the same thing happens.
###### [[GBP/USD]] and [[EUR/GBP]] are positively correlated
###### #AUS is positively correlated with #GOLD . Increase or decrease in price of gold tends to move #AUS in the same direction. Also correlated with coal, copper and agriculture, to a lesser degree.
###### #YEN also positively correlated with gold and when economic times are hard as considered a safe currency

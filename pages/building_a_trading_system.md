#### **What are core-components of a trading systems**
##### #FeedHandler Data
##### #OMS (order management system) aka Broker
##### #PMS (#position management system)
##### #PLProfitLoss
##### #Otherthings
###### Adding Indicators / Analyzers (you may not need them if you for example work on pure bid/ask prices)
###### Charting (whether real-time or only for the backtesting results)
###### Collection of real-time data (although it's a lot better to rely on a reliable data source)
###### ****Start slow by being able to backtest something****:
####### 1. Read a csv file
####### 2. Loop over the data
####### 3. Pass each bar to a Simple Moving Average that calculates the last value
####### 4. Pass each bar to the trading logic (which will rely on a Simple Moving Average to make decisions)
####### #backtesting As inspiration (or simply to use any of them) you can have a look at this list of [[Softwaretools]] Open Source #Python frameworks:

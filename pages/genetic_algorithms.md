## **From meeting with Andrea**
## Where do they work well?
### When you cannot use anything else i.e when they don't work
### When you lazy
### When you have multiple objectives
### Work well when there is no structure.
###
## Where they fail?
###
## How do they cope with uncertainty?
### No good at uncertainty, if your objective is stochastic then they suck
### If big variance on cost function, then you will follow variance of problem, rather than expectation.
### If variance is large, focus on making the
### You need to ensure that the variance is min
### You can ensemble
##
## *Methods*
### Dividing rectangle search (Divide rec)- worked well - has same problems if the function stochastic, you need some expected value in there.

## TODO This is a really cool coin developed my people at Stanford to enable all payment systems to interact with each other seamlessly, by using a decentralised trusted network that is cooperative. Where, for example a #USD transaction by one party is converted into a #Stellar USD coin, that is then propagated through the network to the end party, like internet servers - where all servers receive the request and are updated accordingly, almost instantaneously and then that #Stellar coin is converted to whatever is required by the other party, i.e. #GBP.

## It could revolutionise the ways that businesses and individuals send money globally and even interact with applications - as each app can have its own coin that is converted to #Stellar when being bought and sold.
## See here for a [[Python]] [[flask]]  tutorial for how to create a #Stellar app https://medium.com/stellar-community/build-your-first-stellar-app-using-python-and-flask-pt-1-f2761c9b94df
